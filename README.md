## App descriprtion

This is a Bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read.

In this application, the main page displays a list of "shelves", each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are:

* Currently Reading
* Want to Read
* Read

Each book has a control that lets you select the shelf for that book. When you select a different shelf, the book moves there. 

The main page also has a link to /search on the right bottom of the page, a search page allows you to find books to add to your library.

The search page has a text input that may be used to find books.
